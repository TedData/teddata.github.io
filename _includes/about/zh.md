# About myself

Hi. I'm Peng (Ted) Yu, a dedicated professional in the field of data. Currently, I am interning at IRIS NEXT GEN, focusing on work related to Customer Data Platforms (CDP). My passion lies in the realm of data, and both my work and interests are closely intertwined with it. Each experience I undertake is an opportunity for me to continually expand my data skills. I firmly believe that these experiences will contribute to enriching and continuously enhancing my professional capabilities.

## Embarking on My Career Journey

- In **2013**, in China, after successfully completing my undergraduate studies, I took a significant step forward by venturing to Australia, seeking more learning and career opportunities.

- In **2015**, I seized the opportunity to join Symbio Food Laboratory. Initially, my job responsibilities primarily involved sample processing, ensuring that each laboratory technician could access samples containing all the original information. This role demanded a high degree of precision and focus, laying a solid foundation for experiments. This experience marked a crucial starting point in my professional journey.

## Stepping into the Role of a Team Leader

- As the laboratory expanded, we ascended to become one of the largest food testing companies in Australia.. With the exponential increase in the number of clients and samples, it became increasingly challenging for our lab technicians to locate the required information within the plethora of samples.

- Then, in **2017**, I was presented with the opportunity to be promoted to the role of a team leader. My responsibilities shifted towards the processing and integration of sample data. This encompassed gathering sample data from various companies, standardizing data formats, and storing data within a data warehouse. Simultaneously, I assumed the responsibility of regularly updating the data warehouse to prevent data redundancy. This transition marked a significant milestone in my career journey.

## A Significant Decision

- In **2020**, I encountered a momentous decision in my life. After three years of living separately from my wife, we knew that sacrifices were necessary for us to continue our journey together. The day I left my job took me by surprise, as many colleagues came to comfort me, and the gifts they gave me are still treasured as precious memories.

## Academic Pursuits

- Due to my strong interest in data from my previous work experiences, I developed a deep fascination with the captivating world of "data." Consequently, in **2020**, I made the decision to pursue further knowledge in this field by enrolling in a Master's program in Data Science at the University of Queensland.

- Throughout my academic journey, I delved deep into the mysteries of data, explored the potential of algorithms, and marveled at the magic of decision-making processes. This period of intense learning elevated my understanding and proficiency in working with data to new heights. In the end, I graduated in **2022** with a GPA of 6.13 by 7, a testament to my dedication and hard work.

- This experience has enriched my knowledge base and propelled my career development forward.

## Work Experience

- From **March to May 2023**, I participated in an internship with KSMP. During this period, I was responsible for analyzing automobile sales data for a specific company. I used Python for data preprocessing, which involved extracting relevant information, removing empty data, standardizing formats, and integrating data. Through algorithmic analysis, I gained in-depth insights into the characteristics of car-buying customers, identifying their preferences for different types of automobiles. When acquiring new customer information, I made targeted recommendations, significantly improving the company's sales performance. Finally, I used Tableau to create data visualization reports to better convey data insights.

- From **August to October 2023**, I undertook an internship with IRIS NEXT GEN PTY LTD, where I delved into and mastered the entire workflow and operations of Customer Data Platforms (CDP). CDP is a software tool designed to integrate and manage customer data, aiming to assist businesses in better understanding, managing, and interacting with their customers. This enhances customer satisfaction, increases sales, and improves marketing efficiency. This internship experience enriched my professional knowledge and deepened my understanding of data management and marketing, providing a solid foundation for my career development.
